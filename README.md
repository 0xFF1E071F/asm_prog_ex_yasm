Assembly Programming Exercises
==============================

Forked from xorpd's assembly course. Porting the fasm assembly code for Windows to yasm code for Linux. Work in progress at the moment.

The course is roughly 90% ported and should be useable by all. The structure section is still under development but all others are done!

This repository contains exercises for the Assembly Programming course.
