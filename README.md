Assembly Programming Exercises
==============================

Forked from xorpd's assembly course. Porting the fasm assembly code for Windows to yasm code for Linux. Work in progress at the moment.

The course is roughly 90% ported and should be useable by all. The structure section is still under development but all others are done!

This repository contains exercises for the Assembly Programming course.
More information could be found at http://www.xorpd.net


## Install Instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/blankwall/asm_prog_ex.git
cd asm_prog_ex
./install.s
./test.s
```

If all works hello world should be printed and you will have a directory called assembly with a basic program in it. :) !
